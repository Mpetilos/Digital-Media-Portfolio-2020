    <p><a href="vector/viewingwindow.png">Viewing window</a></p>
    <p>This one took at least 2 hours, maybe 3 to make. I imagine this as the vieewpoint of someone looking out their window just before take-off to some unexplored world, maybe a going away party and a few belongings. </p>
    <p>Image trace; Dogs!</p>

    <p>This was just an image trace, a sort of experimenting with colors. Took about an hour to make.</p>
    <p>Preserved Flower 2020</p>

    <p>This was originally part of an image you see earlier. But before I started making that image I wanted to make some flower of some sort, encased in glass. Thus, this came to life. It took me abour 40 minutes to an hour to complete, so I hope you enjoy it!</p>
